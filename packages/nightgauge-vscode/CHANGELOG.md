# Changelog

All notable changes to the Nightgauge VS Code Extension will be documented in this
file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-09-02

The first build published to the VS Code Marketplace (pre-release channel).
Same product as 0.2.1; the listing and the package were fixed before publishing.

### Changed

- The VSIX no longer ships source maps or type declarations (23 MB and 1,000+
  files smaller) and drops the plugin mirror's test files (#1306)
- Listing metadata: an `AI` category, `extensionKind: workspace`, and explicit
  untrusted-/virtual-workspace declarations (#1306)
- README is the Marketplace page: real dashboard and notification renders
  replace the hand-built mockups; contributor sections moved to the repository
  (#1306)
- Status bar uses the `dashboard` codicon (#1306)
- Release pipeline: one Marketplace publish path, pre-release packaging for
  0.x, and a guard that no source maps ship (#1300, #1307)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-02

First public version on the VS Code Marketplace, published as a **pre-release**
(0.x) on the Marketplace pre-release channel. Builds ship for **macOS (Apple
Silicon and Intel) and Linux x64 only**; there is no Windows build yet. The
Claude Code (`claude` CLI) adapter is the supported path; the Codex, Gemini,
Copilot and direct-API adapters are beta. Multi-repository workspaces and
autonomous mode are available but less finished than the single-repository
loop.

`0.2.0` was tagged on 2026-09-01 but never published: its release run resolved
the release-candidate tag on the same commit and stopped before attaching any
artifact. `0.2.1` is that tree plus the release-pipeline fix; nothing shipped
under `0.2.0`.

### Added

- **Action Center** — repo-scoped attention sweep surfacing decision requests,
  default-branch health, human gates, and terminal failures as cards you can
  act on, with standing-condition semantics and fingerprint-based auto-resolve
  (#98, #99, #103, #189)
- Approve the architecture gate directly from an Action Center card (#181)
- A coverage-gap card can add the missing repository to the workspace in one
  click instead of being a dead end (#728)
- **Slack notifier** — bot-token based, with live-updating run messages, a
  settings UI and a `Configure Slack` command; Go-side alerts reach Slack
  through the same sink (#1081, #1082, #1088)
- **Adapter usage & quota** — a status-bar meter (click to cycle windows) and
  a dashboard panel showing every usage window, per-model breakdown, burn rate
  and projected exhaustion (#685, #694, #698)
- Claude Max plan usage shown as percent used and reset time — the footer
  reports 5-hour and 7-day limits rather than dollars — and the operator can
  declare their Claude plan (#710, #734, #819)
- Opt-in, tiered reporting of adapter usage; telemetry is now opt-out by
  default with the disclosure moved alongside the setting (#737, #739)
- **Workspace Repositories** section in Nightgauge Settings, backed by
  `nightgauge workspace repo add|remove|list` (#715, #729)
- Notifications config block now has a settings surface (#1097)
- Repository-aware project settings — per-repository configuration in
  multi-repo workspaces, with drift detection between layers (#47)
- `max_model` caps automatic model routing per stage (#1216)
- Grok Build CLI adapter (beta) (#529)
- Adapter Doctor probes each CLI adapter's model catalog, flags a stale
  bundled binary, and reports whether every stage can run at all (#509, #602,
  #608, #867)
- `nightgauge --version`, `nightgauge api-usage` (a GitHub API request
  ledger), `nightgauge label rename`, and `nightgauge check-triage` verbs
  (#725, #857, #904, #1265)
- A **Show Diagnostics** command; the six output channels are consolidated
  into one with a durable log sink (#761, #1068)
- Halted repositories are badged in the tree, and unchecked repositories are
  no longer polled (#1236)
- Stage-exit forensics — every stage records its last ten Bash commands, exit
  codes and stderr tail, so a failed run can be diagnosed without re-running
  it (#149, #158)
- Test-execution evidence — `feature-validate` must show a suite actually ran
  before it passes (#176, #1264)
- Scheduled automations that stop firing are noticed and reported (#1005)
- Backlog groom skill for periodic validity, worth and priority re-assessment
  (#614, #1111)

### Changed

- The Claude Code adapter is documented as the supported path; other adapters
  are marked beta, and the Quick Start now matches what a Marketplace install
  actually does (#903, #1140)
- Ready Issues view defaults to a smart sort (Priority → Unblocked → Size →
  Age) instead of board order
- Model pricing, effort tiers and thinking interlocks come from the model
  registry alone; the extension's own pricing table is gone (#97, #415, #437)
- Cost forecasts are priced through the serving adapter's provider, and every
  billable token pool (including cache reads and writes) is counted (#393,
  #588, #721)
- Per-stage cost estimates are calibrated from run history rather than
  rescaled proportionally (#114, #241, #1226)
- A stage that reports an issue is not pipeline work exits with a finding
  instead of a failure (#1164, #1242)
- A terminal failure halts only the repository it happened in, not the whole
  machine (#1166)
- A chronically failing issue is quarantined instead of pausing the fleet, and
  transient provider outages back off with a retry ceiling rather than
  tripping the circuit breaker (#197, #201, #211, #284)
- A killed stage's commit is preserved and the run resumes at `pr-create`
  instead of restarting (#209, #269)
- GitHub polling pauses while views are hidden and the window is unfocused;
  board reads are shared across repositories on the same project and gated
  behind a cheap change probe (#496, #859, #922, #1098)
- Worktrees, local branches and stashes the pipeline creates are reclaimed on
  every terminal outcome, with squash merges detected by content rather than
  ancestry (#118, #215, #334, #587)
- Writes that escape the run's worktree are captured and attributed instead of
  silently landing in a sibling repository (#138)
- Autonomous dispatch refuses issues in the running binary's own repository
  and gates on author trust (#272, #310)
- Runaway detection no longer kills a stage that is still making progress, and
  a stage waiting on a tool call is not killed for waiting (#133, #162, #1086)

### Fixed

- Open GitHub and Open Log tree actions do what they say, and tree item ids
  are stable across refreshes (#1211, #1280)
- The settings webview's dead buttons work again, it no longer nags about
  setup on an uninitialized repo, and it reports its real auto-accept default
  (#905, #1067, #1117)
- Knowledge view finds the knowledge base in every worktree layout, and
  Related Decisions shows real decisions (#1224, #1225)
- Empty, blocked and awaiting-decomposition epics are told apart in the tree
  (#671, #681)
- Adapter auth failures are surfaced instead of halting the queue (#1172)
- Merges past failing non-required checks now say which checks they passed
  (#1252)
- Phases the pipeline never observed are no longer reported as skipped, and a
  failed run stops reporting Health 100 / Excellent (#1062, #1251)
- Stage kills terminate the whole process group, not just the direct child
  (#1256)
- Token and cost telemetry is recorded on every stage-exit path, including
  Codex-routed stages and the run's terminating stage (#69, #113, #116, #187)
- The local branch survives a successful merge, and a branch is never called
  safe to delete while a worktree holds it (#167, #640, #1044)
- Forked branches are detected before a run starts rather than at push time,
  and pushes go through the git CLI so SSH remotes work (#164, #880)
- Standing attention cards stop re-syncing on every sweep and stay open when
  their resolve verb fails (#247, #1245)
- Discord and Mattermost embeds report honest labels, totals and cost, with no
  dangling branch arrow (#408, #678)
- Board membership is keyed on (repository, issue number), and a post-merge
  rollup that could not add the board row now repairs it (#145, #813)
- Run records have a single authoritative writer, ending duplicate and
  cross-contaminated history entries (#143, #827)
- Both assistant tool-call delivery shapes are handled by one code path, fixing
  dropped prompt detection and missing command capture (#170)
- Health snapshots and retros are attributed to the repository whose run
  produced them (#1063, #1232)
- The epic checkpoint can be configured and actually fires; a parent epic is
  resolved against its own repository (#1000, #1184)

### Removed

- The Workflow dashboard view (#1225)
- The `stage_overrides` knob, superseded by `max_model` (#1216)
- The configurable `*_env` credential fields and dead sanitization keys (#987,
  #1112)
- The `useGoBinary` setting, the queue-reorder surface, and the Focus Mode
  ROI comparison — none of which did anything (#974, #979, #981)

### Security

- Credentials moved into VS Code secure storage
- Output channel and configuration inspection are redacted; merged settings
  stay local
- Configuration paths that escape the workspace are rejected
- Resolved Go and JavaScript CodeQL findings, including two polynomial-ReDoS
  regexes, and cleared high-severity npm advisories (#72, #317, #320)

<!--
Compare/release links intentionally omitted: only release-candidate tags
(v0.2.0-rc.*) have been pushed to nightgauge/nightgauge, so a v0.1.0...v0.2.0
compare link would 404. Add tag-based links here once v0.2.0 is tagged.
