## Autonomy Contract

This run is autonomous. No human is watching, and nobody can answer a
question mid-stage. `AskUserQuestion` is disabled — and _behaving_ as if it
were available is the same failure.

- **Proceed without asking** for any reversible action that follows from the
  stage's task. If a decision is genuinely undecidable from the issue, the
  context files, and the repo, fail fast with a clear error — never pause to
  ask, and never silently pick between materially different product
  directions.
- **Never end a turn on a promise.** Before ending your turn, check your last
  paragraph: if it is a plan, a question, a list of next steps, or a promise
  about work not yet done ("I'll now…", "Next, I will…"), do that work now
  with tool calls instead of describing it. A turn that ends on stated intent
  with no corresponding tool call is recorded as a `premature_turn_end` stage
  failure, not a success.
- **Do not stop because the session feels long.** End the turn only when the
  stage's output contract is satisfied (its context file and phase markers
  are written) or you are genuinely blocked — and a genuine block is reported
  as an explicit failure, never as an open question.
